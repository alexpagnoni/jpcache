  Summary:
    jpcache is a lightweight, full page caching system for PHP, thus
    reducing server-load, as pages are generated less often.
    It also uses gzip content-encodig and ETag-headers, which results
    in around 80% in traffic-saving for php-pages.
    You can choose to store your files in a local dir or in a database.
  
  Features:
    - Caches full pages.
    - When not modified since last visit, sends 304 response
    - When modified or first visit, sends gzipped content if possible, 
      else uncompressed content
